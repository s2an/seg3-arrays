### Confidence
Fairly confident regarding the layout of array.method and seeing how it outputs.
### Additional Learning
I am going to look up some examples of Ruby code at work. I don't really understand how these methods would be useful in practice.
### ?'s about Arrays
I know in Excel an Array would work differently and cause problems if you didn't know to look out for them. With how early we learned about Arrays, are they more standard to use than singletons?
